# atix
This is a new version of Neltume, a Language Learning Devices for the Blind.

This new version is made completly from scratch and with a different Platform (Arduino instead of Raspberry Pi), and therefore
is programmed in C instead of Python3.

Atix runs in a lower level than Neltume, but that is also a great Benefit, because the total price and form factor is smaller.
